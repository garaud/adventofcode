# Day 02

**Rock Paper Scissors**

## Part One

> To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant Rock Paper
> Scissors tournament is already in progress.

> The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2
> for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if
> you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won)

Strategy guide:

```
A Y
B X
C Z
```

* A or X for Rock (1 point)
* B or Y for Paper (2 point)
* C or Z for Scissors (3 point)

* 0 if you lost
* 3 if the round was draw
* 6 if you won

## Part Two

> The Elf finishes helping with the tent and sneaks back over to you. "Anyway, the
> second column says how the round needs to end: X means you need to lose, Y means
> you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means you need to win. Good luck!"
