# AoC 2024

The resources files for test and main input text files are in a folder specified by the `AOC_2024` environment variable.

Each file is in a subfolder which looks like `$AOC_2024/day-01`.

It's also possible to make a symlink to the resources folder `ln -s /path/to/resources ./inputs` in the main language
folder.
