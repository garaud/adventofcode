**Lanternfish**

Model the growth rate of lanternfish.

> Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish, you make some
> guesses about their attributes. Surely, each lanternfish creates a new lanternfish
> once every 7 days.

> However, this process isn't necessarily synchronized between every lanternfish -
> one lanternfish might have 2 days left until it creates another lanternfish, while
> another might have 4. So, you can model each fish as a single number that
> represents the number of days until it creates a new lanternfish.
