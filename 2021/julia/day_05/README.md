# Day 05

**Hydrothermal Venture**

## Part one

> You come across a field of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor! These vents
> constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if
> possible.

```
0,9 -> 5,9
8,0 -> 0,8
9,4 -> 3,4
2,2 -> 2,1
7,0 -> 7,4
6,4 -> 2,0
0,9 -> 2,9
3,4 -> 1,4
0,0 -> 8,8
5,5 -> 8,2
```

> Each line of vents is given as a line segment in the format x1,y1 -> x2,y2 where
> x1,y1 are the coordinates of one end the line segment and x2,y2 are the coordinates
> of the other end.

## Part two

Also take into account diagonals.
