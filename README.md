# Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/

Try to solve some problems with different programming languages such as Clojure (I love Lispy Programming Language!), Julia (I'm quite familiar with Python, so...) and Elixir. I would like to try with Rust.

For each year and each daily problem, I try to make some unit tests with the sample of data given in the description. The README files, in each folder, specifies how you can run the code and the tests.

Unfortunately, there are only one week of solved problems each year...

As the Advent of Code does not allow to redistribute the data, I don't add the different inputs to this repo. Take a look at https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying

The repo supposed that you have a `resources` folder in the repo root path with `resources/<year>/<day-nn>` with the
different input text files necessary to run the tests or to solve the main input file.


## 2020 (Clojure)

Clojure's inspiring me...

See [2020/clojure](2020/clojure)


## 2021 (Julia)

Give it a try with Julia.

See [2021/julia](2021/julia)


## 2022 (Julia)

Julia again.

See [2022/julia](2022/julia)


## 2023 (Elixir)

Some Elixir. I'm just curious about a Erlang family language (BEAM!)

See [2023/elixir](2023/elixir)


## 2024 (Elixir and Python)

Once again, I try Elixir but also Python.

Note that I'm quite confortable with Python because I daily use this programming language for many years.
