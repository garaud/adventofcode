# Day 06

Custom Customs

26 yes-no questions (one letter by question). Each group answer yes to some questions.

## Part one

For each group, count the number of questions to which anyone answered "yes". What is
the sum of those counts?

Launch with `clj -X day-06.part-one/run`.

## Part two

You don't need to identify the questions to which anyone answered "yes"; you need to
identify the questions to which everyone answered "yes"!

Launch with `clj -X day-06.part-two/run`.
