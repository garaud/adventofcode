Avoid trees when you're traveling!

You start on the open square `(.)` in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom
(below the bottom-most row on your map).

## Part One

Current toggogan slope: **right 3, down 1**.

Launch with `clj -X day-03.part-one/run`.

## Part Two

There are many different slopes!

- Right 1, down 1.
- Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
- Right 5, down 1.
- Right 7, down 1.
- Right 1, down 2.

Multiply together the number of trees encountered on each of the listed slopes.

Launch with `clj -X day-03.part-two/run`.
